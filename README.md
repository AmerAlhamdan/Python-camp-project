# This project is for Python camp that was in Imam Muhammed bin Saud University

# This project does some simple math operations, like addition and subtraction, by using multiple function for each operation.

# The best benefit of this project is that it uses Exception class to avoid crashes for dividing by zero, and use switch method, like the one java, to select which operation to use.
